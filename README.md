# SQL for Data Science

This is a SQL for Data Science course on Coursera that is provided by UC Davis and taught by Sadie Lawrence. Here are some of the skills that I've gained throughout this course:
-  the fundamentals of SQL which allows me to begin analyzing data for data science purposes.
-  learned how to write both simple and complex queries to select wanted data from tables.
-  gained experience working with different types of data including strings and numbers and utilize different methods to filter and pare down results.
-  learned how to create new tables and be able to move data into them.
-  learned common operators and how to combine data.
-  learned how to interpret the structure, meaning, and relationship in source data and use SQL as a professional to shape data for targeted analysis purposes.
